## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned what TS is, how it differs from JavaScript, how to install it and what commands to use to compile TS into JS

2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned what data types there are in TS, how they differ from each other, in what cases it is better to use which one and how it helps me to avoid errors in code.

3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned what an interface is, its difference from an alias, how to use an interface and extend it, and how to declare an interface with custom array types.

4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned how functions can be typed, what arguments a function can have, and how to type the return value.

5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned how to work with classes in TS, how to create an instance of a class, how to define properties and methods, what access modifiers are, how you can inherit from a class, how you can combine an interface and a class, and the advantages of using classes and interfaces.

6. **Generics in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned what generics are, in what cases it is better to use them, advantages over any type, and also learned how to implement generic constraints.

7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned how to organize code using modules, how modules differ from namespaces, and how to import an external type library.

8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**

   ‚úçÔ∏è I learned what namespaces are, how to implement single-file and multi-file namespaces and why it is preferable to use modules.
