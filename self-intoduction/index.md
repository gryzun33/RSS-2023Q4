Hi, my name is Olya, I am the second time in RSSchool and perhaps this is the most difficult task for me on this course so far.

I'm a power engineer by education. After graduating from university I went to work as a project engineer on the electrical part, and worked in this area for about 8 years. Then, I went on a long-term maternity leave. During that time, I didn't want to waste any time, so on the advice of friends, I joined the RSSschool frontend-developer course in 2020 Q3.

Since I have a technical mindset, I got really interested in all of this pretty quickly. And overall, I have always loved learning, and when you find understandable sources of information and see the results of your studies, learning becomes even more interesting. In that mood, I somehow finished stage 2 in 2021. Then I had to take a break. And now, when I have a bit more time, I decided to go back to studying.

If we're talking about the main goal for today, it's probably employment. To achieve this, I plan to complete this course, a course on a framework, and a course on node.js. But even if things don't go as planned, I realize that I've already gained a lot of programming knowledge and just got my brain working, which isn't a bad thing at all.

So far I don't have any personal projects other than educational, and my favorite project in this course is a random game at stage 0 where there was enough freedom to implement. I tried to write the game Lines 98 which I loved playing as a child.
The main challenge of implementing this game was finding the shortest path from point A to point B. I found out that this algorithm is called A star or Dijkstra's algorithm. I understood how it works, but I couldn't implement it in JavaScript. I decided to get around this problem and implement it without this algorithm, but I want to come back to this to close the issue.

Overall, I am happy with the result at this stage.

If I add a bit more about myself outside of the IT topic, I really love music in all its forms, and I have a soft spot for people with a good sense of humor.

Well, I guess that's it. And, I did it.Thanks for listening, bye!
