## Reflections

1. I learned what TS is, how it differs from JavaScript, how to install it and what commands to use to compile TS into JS
2. I learned what data types there are in TS, how they differ from each other, in what cases it is better to use which one and how it helps me to avoid errors in code.
3. I learned what an interface is, its difference from an alias, how to use an interface and extend it, and how to declare an interface with custom array types.
4. I learned how functions can be typed, what arguments a function can have, and how to type the return value.
5. I learned hoe to work with classes in TS, how to create an instance of a class, how to define properties and methods, what access modifiers are, how you can inherit from a class, how you can combine an interface and a class, and the advantages of using classes and interfaces.
